# Spark ETL Frmework

## Motivation:
I am asssigned to a project to migrate the ETL jobs from DataStage to something open source.
The ETL was written in SQL in ELT style and Datastage is used for staging and workflow management.
After research and lot of discussions we settled on Spark as the ETL engine and AirFlow as the workflow
management tool. 
This package has been developed for the following goals:
- Unifying the ETL jobs development style.
- Making the data engineer to focus only the ETL logic and to fulfil the requirements. 
- Supporting any kind of data lineage to be developed on top of the developed jobs by using open format (json)
